  <h1>Buying from the Digital Marketplace</h1>

  <h2>Digital Marketplace overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Digital Marketplace makes it easy to engage digital specialist services. As an agile development, the Marketplace will expand over time to offer more services, more sellers and ways to do business.
  </p>

  <h2>What can you buy</h2>
  
  <h3>Digital specialists</h3>
  <p>
    These are individual specialists with the skills essential to deliver today’s digital projects. Find out more about the <a href="{{ url_for('main.roles_and_services') }}">capabilities</a> available, including guidance on the rates you might expect to pay.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>
    If you need a team of digital specialists with the expertise to deliver an outcome, for example a booking system or a website redesign and development.
  </p>

  <h2>About the sellers</h2>
  <p>
    There are more than 200 sellers in the Digital Marketplace who can deliver professional services and outcomes for digital projects. You’ll need to make your own assessment about whether a seller has the skills, experience and suitability for your own project.
  </p>
  <p>
    All sellers in the Digital Marketplace are members of the Digital Service Professionals Panel (SON3364729) and have accepted the Marketplace’s <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/DSPP_Deed_of_Standing_Offer.pdf" target="_blank">Deed of Standing Offer</a>. This deed provides the basis of any contract you enter for services procured through the Marketplace. This panel was established through an open approach to market by the Digital Transformation Office.
  </p>
  
  <h2>How to find and engage sellers for your digital project</h2>
  <p>
    There are 2 ways to engage sellers on the Digital Marketplace.
  </p>

  <h3>Publish a brief</h3>
  <p>
    Publish a brief of your requirements and evaluation criteria in the Marketplace for 1 or 2 weeks. Sellers can apply online if they meet the essential evaluation criteria you’ve set, and are available when you need them. After your brief closes, you’ll only need to evaluate in detail the number of sellers you said you would consider (for example, just the top 3 responses).
  </p>

  <h3>Publish brief to selected sellers</h3>
  <p>
    If you want to limit the number of sellers who can respond, at the end of building your brief you can choose to invite one or more sellers to respond. Your brief will still be published in the Marketplace but only the sellers you nominate are able to apply.
  </p>

  <h2>Documents and templates</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/Requirements_Brief_Template.xlsx" target="_blank">Draft requirements template</a><br>
    Use this template if you want to develop and socialise your requirements before creating a brief in the Digital Marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/Scoring_Template.xlsx" target="_blank">Evaluation template</a><br>
    Use this template when evaluating which seller best meets your needs after you’ve shortlisted the responses to your requirements brief.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/DSPP_Deed_of_Standing_Offer.pdf" target="_blank">Deed of Standing Offer</a><br>
    This document details the terms under which sellers are contracted through the Digital Marketplace.
  </p>

  <h2>Commonwealth Procurement Rules</h2>
  <p>
    All sellers listed in the Digital Marketplace are on the Digital Service Professionals Panel (SON3364729). This panel was established through an open approach to market by the Digital Transformation Office and has complied with the requirements of conducting an open tender as set out in the  Commonwealth Procurement Rules. All panel members have executed a Deed of Standing Offer which can be accessed <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/DSPP_Deed_of_Standing_Offer.pdf">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the Digital Marketplace makes it easy to comply with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules as a government buyer, you are still responsible for complying with these rules and any Accountable Authority Instructions related to procurement in your agency or issued by the Department of Finance. If you’re not sure of these requirements, please check with the procurement section in your own agency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Local, state and territory government buyers are welcome to use the Digital Marketplace but should make sure that they comply with any additional procurement rules that apply in their state or territory.
  </p>
