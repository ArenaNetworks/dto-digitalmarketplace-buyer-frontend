  <h1>Buyer's guide</h1>
  <p>
    The Digital Marketplace makes it easier for government buyers to engage specialist digital services. As an agile development, the Marketplace will grow over time to offer more services, more sellers and more ways to do business.
  </p>

  <h3>Introducing our buyers</h3>
  <p>
    If you work in government and you need to procure digital services you can become a buyer in the Digital Marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our buyers are from across all levels of government — local, state and federal — and from corporate government entities such as the ABC and Melbourne Water.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have an email address ending in <b>.gov.au</b> you can create a buyer account now.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you work in government but your email is different we will need to confirm you are a government entity before you can register. Email your request to <a href="mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au">marketplace@digital.gov.au</a>
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>Who are the sellers</h3>

  <p>
    There are <a href="{{ url_for('main.supplier_search') }}">hundreds of sellers</a> in the Marketplace who can deliver professional services and outcomes for digital projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    All sellers in the Marketplace are members of the Digital Service Professionals Panel (SON3364729) and have accepted the Marketplace’s <a href="{{ asset_path }}media/documents/DSPP_Deed_of_Standing_Offer.pdf">Deed of Standing Offer</a>. This deed provides the basis of any contract you enter for services procured through the Marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every Marketplace seller has been through an approval process, but you still need to make your own assessment about whether a seller is suitable for your own project.
  </p>

  <h2>What you can buy</h2>

  <h3>Outcomes</h3>
  <p>
    If you need a team of digital specialists with the expertise to deliver an outcome, such as a new responsive website or an accessibility audit, you can find them in the Marketplace.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a role="button" href="{{url_for('main.info_page_for_starting_a_brief', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', lot_slug='digital-outcome')}}">Create a brief for an outcome</a>
  </p>

  <h3>Specialists</h3>
  <p>
    Engage individual specialists with the <a href="{{ url_for('main.roles_and_services') }}">essential skills</a> to deliver today’s digital projects through the Marketplace.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a role="button" href="{{url_for('main.info_page_for_starting_a_brief', framework_slug='digital-service-professionals', lot_slug='digital-professionals')}}">Create a brief for an individual</a>
  </p>

  <h2>How to buy</h2>

  <h3>Publishing a brief</h3>

  <p>
    Publish a brief of your requirements and evaluation criteria in the Marketplace for 1 or 2 weeks. Sellers can apply online if they meet the essential evaluation criteria you’ve set, and are available when you need them. After your brief closes, you’ll only need to evaluate in detail the number of sellers you said you would consider (for example, just the top 3 responses).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to limit the number of sellers who can respond, at the end of building your brief you can choose to invite one or more sellers to respond. Your brief will still be published in the Marketplace but only the sellers you nominate are able to apply.
  </p>





  <h3>Awarding a contract</h3>
  <p>
    After shortlisting and evaluating sellers who respond to your brief you can award a contract by creating and signing a Work Order.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you’re logged in and viewing your <a href="{{ url_for('buyers.buyer_dashboard') }}">dashboard</a> simply click the link for ‘create a work order’ beside any closed briefs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the information will be pre-filled in based on the information from your brief, some you will have to provide with the help of your chosen seller. Once complete, you can print and sign creating the contract.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h2>Commonwealth Procurement Rules</h2>
  <p>
    All sellers listed in the Marketplace are on the Digital Service Professionals Panel (SON3364729).
  </p>
  <p>
    This panel was established through an open approach to market by the Digital Transformation Office and meets the requirements of an open tender as set out in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although the Marketplace makes it easy to comply with the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, you’re still responsible for complying with these rules and any Accountable Authority Instructions related to procurement in your agency or issued by the Department of Finance. If you’re not sure of these requirements, please check with the procurement team in your own agency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Local, state and territory government buyers are welcome to use the Marketplace but should make sure that they comply with any additional procurement rules that apply in their state or territory.
  </p>
