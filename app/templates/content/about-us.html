  <a id="our-purpose"></a><h2>Our purpose</h2>
  <p>
    The Marketplace is an initiative of the <em>National Innovation &amp; Science Agenda</em> in response to a specific ICT industry problem. Currently, startups and small-to-medium suppliers of digital services find it hard to participate in large scale Australian Government ICT procurement, which leaves these key players and their expertise out of the $5 billion annual spend on ICT products and services.
  </p>
  <p>
    And so, the purpose of the Marketplace is to create a new arena that makes it easier for all ICT businesses to compete more openly for government contracts, with an end-goal of creating better services for all Australians.
  </p>
  <p>
    For government buyers, the Marketplace is somewhere to discover new ideas, solve problems and find approved ICT partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    For ICT professionals it’s a place to offer products and services, compete for government contracts, pitch ideas and get involved with ideation &mdash; regardless of whether you’re a sole trader, startup or a multinational.
  </p>
  <a id="our-process"></a><h2>Our process</h2>
  <p>
    First, ICT professionals list their business and services within the Marketplace, currently this is being done by an internal Marketplace team. But soon this will be something suppliers can do themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    The supplier services are broken down and listed according to the specific field of expertise &mdash; for example 'user research' or 'ethical hacking' &mdash; with upfront price estimates. This approach simplifies procurement and allows greater scope for collaboration and innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Government buyers search the Marketplace, identify suitable suppliers and procure the best value option for their project.
  </p>
  <p>
    Government buyers can also challenge the Marketplace to develop solutions to their specific problem or brief.
  </p>
  <a id="our-progress"></a><h2>Our progress</h2>
  <p>
    The Marketplace is Agile. Which means continuous delivery and improvement through feedback from users. The features of the site will be enhanced and expanded over time in response to user needs. It’s an approach that’s allowed us to come a long way in a short time.

  <a id="compliance-with-cprs"></a><h2>Compliance with Commonwealth Procurement Rules?</h2>
  <p>
    Every business listed within the Marketplace is listed on the Digital Services Panel (DSP).
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the <a href="http://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/buying/procurement-practice/panel-and-mul/practice.html">Commonwealth Procurement Rules</a>:
  </p>
  <p>
    This means everyone in government that is in a position to commission ICT products and services can freely use any of the businesses listed in the Marketplace &mdash; for the products or services specified &mdash; without a minimum or maximum spend.
