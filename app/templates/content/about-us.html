  <a id="how-the-marketplace-started"></a><h2>How the Marketplace started</h2>
  <p>
    Recently, startups and small to medium suppliers of digital services have found it difficult to participate in Australian Government procurements for large scale ICT solutions. To make it easier for smaller businesses to compete for government's $5 billion a year spend on ICT, we're creating a new digital marketplace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Based on a successful UK model, the GOV.AU Marketplace is an online directory of digital and technological services for government agencies to procure ICT solutions from small to medium-sized enterprises. It's also a place for government buyers to discover new ideas and challenge ICT suppliers to develop more innovative government services. 
  </p>
  <a id="how-the-marketplace-works"></a><h2>How the Marketplace works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In the Marketplace, large scale ICT requirements are broken down into <a href="{{ url_for('main.roles_and_services') }}">individual component roles</a>, which scales down procurement and allows greater scope for innovation. 
    </li>
    <li>
      ICT suppliers can <a href="{{ url_for('main.new_seller') }}">join the Marketplace</a> easily.
    </li>
    <li>
      Government buyers can <a href="{{ url_for('main.supplier_search') }}">search the Marketplace</a> for services, identify suitable suppliers and procure the best value option for the project.
    </li>
    <li>
      Government buyers can register their interest in being part of ideation events, hackathons and an upcoming ideation platform, in order to <a href="{{ url_for('main.ideation') }}">challenge ICT suppliers</a> to develop innovative ideas for their projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      ICT suppliers can contact the Marketplace to <a href="{{ url_for('main.pitch') }}">pitch an idea</a> or an improvement to government services.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <a id="whats-next-for-the-marketplace"></a><h2>What's next for the Marketplace</h2>
  <p>
    The Marketplace is agile. Which means continuous delivery and improvement through feedback from users. The features of the site will be enhanced and expanded over time in response to user needs. It's an approach that's allowed us to come a long way in a short time.
