    <p>
        Developers build software in a team with a relentless focus on how it will be used. They write quality
        well-tested code and try to find the simplest solution to a given problem. Some will specialise in being a front
        end or a back end developer but most will have solid skills in both. A good team has a mix of front and back end
        skills. As they work, they’re expected to keep security, accessibility and open standards in mind, and improve
        ("refactor") the technical implementation as they go along.

        <i>Designs user-focused services that meet web standards and contributes to the development and continual

    </p>
    <p>
        The Service Designer uses design practices to take the intuitive leap from research to identifying ways that the
        service could be delivered so that it better meets user needs, across all users, delivery channels and
        touchpoints. Creates a blueprint or map of the proposed service, ensuring that key elements are built in from
        the outset. Contributes to the development and continual enhancement of products, partnering with colleagues to
        facilitate a consistent user experience.
