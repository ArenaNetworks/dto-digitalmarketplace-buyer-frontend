We keep and track all versions of the site terms.  We need to do this because
the version of the terms a user has agreed to might not be the latest, live
version.

To create a new revision, put the updated terms into a new .html file.  The file
name should be the date and time when the revision becomes active.  For example,
if a revision is meant to be active starting the 2nd of April, 2016, at 3pm, the
file name should be "2016-04-02 15:00.html".  This "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM.html"
format is important because it's used to automatically verify terms acceptance
by users.

The new revision needs to be made active by setting DM_CURRENT_TERMS_DATE in
config.py in the root of the repository.  For example, the above revision would
be made active by making the setting into

	DM_CURRENT_TERMS_DATE = '2016-04-02 15:00'

After making a revision, you should verify that everything's working correctly by

1. Checking that the right version of the terms appears on the site
2. Running the automated tests and seeing that they pass
