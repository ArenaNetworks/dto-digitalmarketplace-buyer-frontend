		Hi {{ form.manager_name.data }},
	</p>

	<p>
		{{ form.name.data }} has requested your authorisation to create a buyer account on the Digital Marketplace.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your authorisation is needed because a buyer account gives the account holder access to sellers' commercial in confidence information. Account holders can also request quotes and place orders on behalf of your agency.
	</p>

	<p>
		To authorise use of the Digital Marketplace you must be an employee under the Commonwealth Public Service Act (1999) or equivalent state or territory legislation. 
	</p>

	<p>
		If you are, and you wish to authorise {{ form.name.data }} to use the Digital Marketplace, please forward this email to <a href="mailto:marketplace@dta.gov.au">marketplace@dta.gov.au</a> with the comment '<strong>approved</strong>'.
	</p>
