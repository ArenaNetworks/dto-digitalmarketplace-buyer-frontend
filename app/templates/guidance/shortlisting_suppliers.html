    <h2 id="before-you-can-shortlist">Before you can shortlist</h2>

    <p>After you publish your requirements and evaluation criteria, interested suppliers say:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>if they can meet your essential skills and experience requirements</li>
        <li>if they can meet your nice-to-have skills and experience requirements</li>
        <li>when they can start work</li>
        <li>their day rate (specialists only)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Suppliers who can’t meet your essential skills and experience requirements are notified when
        they apply that they’re not eligible.</p>

    <p>Suppliers haven’t provided any proof of their skills and experience yet.</p>

    <h2 id="why-you-need-to-shortlist">Why you need to shortlist</h2>

    <p>You need to shortlist or ‘sift’ interested suppliers to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>ensure the suppliers that best meet your needs progress to the evaluation stage</li>
        <li>avoid having too many suppliers to evaluate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You can use some or all of the shortlist criteria. Any criteria you choose, eg when the
        supplier can start work, must be used to filter all suppliers. You don’t have to shortlist
        suppliers if you want to take them all through to the evaluation stage.</p>

    <h2 id="how-many-suppliers-to-evaluate">How many suppliers to evaluate</h2>

    <p>You have to state the maximum number of suppliers you’ll evaluate when you publish your
        requirements.</p>

    <p>You can only exceed this number if:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>there’s a tie</li>
        <li>you only take a few more suppliers through to the evaluation stage than you said you
            would
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Most buyers find that evaluating up to 10 suppliers is manageable. You must aim to evaluate
        at least 3 suppliers. If only 1 or 2 suppliers meet your requirements, you can evaluate just
        those suppliers.</p>

    <h2 id="how-to-shortlist-interested-suppliers">How to shortlist interested suppliers</h2>

    <h3 id="when-the-supplier-can-start-work">When the supplier can start work</h3>

    <p>You can exclude a supplier if they can’t start work by the latest start date you gave in your
        requirements.</p>

    <h3 id="nice-to-have-skills-and-experience">Nice-to-have skills and experience</h3>

    <p>Order the list of suppliers by those that meet the most of your nice-to-have skills and
        experience requirements. You can exclude suppliers with the fewest nice-to-have skills and
        experience to get to the number of suppliers you said you’d evaluate when you published your
        requirements.</p>

    <p>If you said you would weight individual criteria by adding ‘points’ to each criteria, then
        you can’t use these points to weight essential and nice-to-have skills and experience at the
        shortlist stage. You can only use individual criteria weightings at the evaluation
        stage.</p>

    <h3 id="day-rate-specialists-only">Day rate (specialists only)</h3>

    <p>You can exclude a specialist if their day rate exceeds the maximum budget you published with
        your requirements.</p>

    <p>If you don’t provide a day rate in your requirements, you won’t be able to exclude
        specialists that exceed your budget.</p>

    <p>If you think the supplier has offered an unusually low day rate, you must ask them to explain
        their rate. If the supplier’s explanation isn’t good enough, you may need to exclude them.
        The <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/102/regulation/69/made">Public
            Contracts Regulations 2015</a> have more information on what to do if you receive an
        unusually low quote.</p>

    <h3 id="how-to-check-a-specialists-day-rate">How to check a specialist’s day rate</h3>

    <p>If, after you’ve asked a supplier to explain an unusually low day rate, they provide an
        alternative rate, you must email <a
                href="mailto:enquiries@digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk">enquiries@digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk</a>
        to check their new day rate doesn’t exceed the maximum day rate they provided when they
        applied to the framework.</p>

    <p>If the new day rate does exceed the one the supplier provided in their framework application,
        you can exclude them or ask them to reduce it so it’s under their maximum day rate.</p>

    <h3 id="what-to-do-if-your-shortlist-is-too-long">What to do if your shortlist is too long</h3>

    <p>The number of suppliers on your shortlist might exceed the number of suppliers you said you’d
        evaluate when you published your requirements and evaluation criteria.</p>

    <p>You can either:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>choose to take all the top-scoring suppliers through to the evaluation stage</li>
        <li>reduce the number of suppliers by asking them to provide proof of their essential and
            nice-to-have skills and experience
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="ask-suppliers-to-give-proof-of-their-skills-and-experience">Ask suppliers to give proof
        of their skills and experience</h4>

    <p>To reduce the number of suppliers to the number you said you’d evaluate when you published
        your requirements, you could ask suppliers to fill in the <a
                href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/digital-outcomes-and-specialists-templates-and-legal-documents#shortlisting-templates">shortlisted
            suppliers’ evidence template</a> and evaluate the evidence they give.</p>

    <p>You must give suppliers the deadline for their responses. Give them at least 5 working days
        to provide written evidence of their essential and nice-to-have skills and experience. You
        mustn’t view suppliers’ responses until after the deadline.</p>

    <p>Score the evidence suppliers provide using the scoring scheme. You can’t use half scores.
        Exclude suppliers who get less than 2 for any essential skill or experience.</p>

    <p>If you said you would weight individual criteria by adding ‘points’ to each criteria, then
        you can’t use these points to weight evidence of essential and nice-to-have skills and
        experience at the shortlist stage.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Score</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Not met or no evidence</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Partially met</td>
        </tr>

            <td>2</td>
            <td>Met</td>

    <h3 id="unsuccessful-suppliers">Unsuccessful suppliers</h3>

    <p>After you’ve filtered supplier responses, you must notify the unsuccessful suppliers by
        email. You can send the same email to all suppliers you’re excluding because:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>they can’t start when you need them to</li>
        <li>their day rate is above your budget (specialists only)</li>
        <li>they had the fewest nice-to-have skills and experience</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you send the same email to all the unsuccessful suppliers, make sure you hide their names
        and email addresses from view.</p>

    <p>If you’ve asked suppliers to provide evidence of their essential and nice-to-have skills and
        experience, give them feedback on why they’ve been excluded.</p>

    <h3 id="successful-suppliers">Successful suppliers</h3>

    <p>You must email all the shortlisted suppliers with the same information, making sure you hide
        names and email addresses from view.</p>

    <p>Provide suppliers with all the information they need to take part in the <a
