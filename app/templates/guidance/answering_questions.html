                            what they’re for and when suppliers can ask them</h2>

                        <p>When you post your Digital Service and Professionals requirements on the Digital Marketplace,
                            all eligible suppliers can apply for the work. If a supplier needs to clarify something in
                            your requirements, they can ask you a question, also known as a ‘clarification’ question,
                            through the Digital Marketplace. You must respond so the supplier can decide whether a piece
                            of work is right for them and whether to offer their services.</p>

                        <p>When you publish your requirements, suppliers will be given a date by which they must ask any
                            questions they have. This should give you enough time to answer them.</p>

                        <h2 id="how-youll-know-if-a-supplier-has-asked-a-question">How you’ll know if a supplier has
                            asked a question</h2>

                        <p>When a supplier asks a question, you’ll be sent an email to the address you gave when you
                            created your Digital Marketplace account. Ensure this email address will be monitored. If
                            you’re away during the time when suppliers can ask questions, you should make sure your
                            emails are forwarded to a colleague.</p>

                            transparent way</h2>

                        <p>You must make sure that suppliers have access to the same information about the work. This
                            means all suppliers will have an equal opportunity to win the contract. All questions and
                            answers will be published on the <a href="{{ url_for('.supplier_search') }}">Digital
                                Marketplace</a> so anyone can see them.</p>

                        <p>You must:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>post all questions and answers on the Digital Marketplace</li>
                            <li>remove any reference to the supplier’s name or any confidential information about the
                                supplier
                            </li>
                            <li>give an individual response to each question even when questions are similar</li>
                            <li>answer all questions at least one working day before the deadline to give suppliers time
                                to decide if the work is right for them
                            </li>
                            <li>get commercial or legal advice if you don’t think you’ll be able to answer, or haven’t
                                answered, all the questions at least one working day before the deadline
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You should answer questions:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>within 2 to 3 working days</li>
                            <li>more frequently when the deadline is approaching</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2 id="giving-useful-answers">Giving useful answers</h2>

                        <p>You should make sure you answer every part of a supplier question as they often include
                            several queries. Providing links to supporting information can be helpful.</p>

                        <h2 id="difficult-confusing-or-commercially-sensitive-supplier-questions">Difficult, confusing
                            or commercially sensitive supplier questions</h2>

                        <p>If you receive a question that you don’t understand, you can ask the supplier to explain what
                            they mean in your answer. All suppliers will see your response, and the supplier can then
                            rephrase their question and ask it again.</p>

                        <p>You must not reveal commercially sensitive information when you answer a supplier question,
                            for example the supplier’s price for the work or how they plan to solve your problem.</p>

                        <h2 id="holding-a-session-to-answer-supplier-questions">Holding a session to answer supplier
                            questions</h2>

                        <p>You can hold a question and answer session to answer a lot of supplier questions at the same
                            time. This should mean that suppliers don’t ask duplicate questions.</p>

                        <p>If you give suppliers 1 week to apply to a specialists requirement, your question and answer
                            session must be in the first 2 working days after you publish. This will give suppliers time
                            to review the additional information provided before applying.</p>

                        <p>If suppliers have 2 weeks to apply, it’s best to hold a session 3 or 4 days after you publish
                            your requirements so suppliers have a chance to think of questions to ask.</p>

                        <p>You can hold a:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>webinar</li>
                            <li>conference call</li>

                        <h2 id="how-a-question-and-answer-session-works">How a question and answer session works</h2>

                        <p>Suppliers who attend a question and answer session can ask questions through a chat feature
                            in the webinar software or over the phone during a conference call. You should appoint
                            someone to run the session. They should:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>make each question visible to everyone in the session</li>
                            <li>not disclose the name of the supplier</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>You should make sure the right people are available to answer questions, for example a
                            technical person should be present to answer technical questions. If you need to ask for
                            information from a team member who isn’t present, you should tell the supplier you’ll
                            publish an answer on the Digital Marketplace later.</p>

                        <h2 id="after-a-question-and-answer-session">After a question and answer session</h2>

                        <p>You must post all questions and answers from each session on the Digital Marketplace so
                            suppliers who didn’t attend aren’t at a disadvantage.</p>

                        <h2 id="software-for-a-webinar">Software for a webinar</h2>

                        <p>Your software should include these features:</p>

                            <li>dial-in: so the buyer and suppliers can join the webinar</li>

                            <li>recording: so questions and answers can be transcribed and shared with other suppliers
                                through the Digital Marketplace
                            </li>
                            <li>screen-sharing: so the buyer can share a presentation</li>
